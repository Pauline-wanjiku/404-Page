<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview
Above I have linked a url for the demo solution.

Enjoyable project to build, it being a simple page helped me undestanding how tailwind works. Some of the things I learnt and undestood better was grid and media query since the project was web responsive.

Lesson learnt:Build simple and small while learning a new technology this helps with having a stronger foundation for more complex and bigger projects.
